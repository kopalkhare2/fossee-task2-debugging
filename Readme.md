## Objective

The purpose of this task was to create a prompt that guides an AI assistant to help students debug Python code **without giving them the final solution**.  

I wanted the AI to **teach through questions and hints**, so the student (me!) can understand and solve errors independently.

##  Reasoning & Thought Process

### Tone & Approach
I made the AI sound **friendly and encouraging**, like a personal tutor. This makes learning less stressful and more effective.  

### Guiding, Not Solving
- The AI identifies bug types (logic, syntax, etc.) but **never writes the solution**.
- It asks **reflective questions**, helping me think critically and debug myself.
- Conceptual hints are given instead of direct answers.

### Adapting to Skill Level
- **Beginners:** Simple questions, basic debugging like `print()` statements.
- **Advanced learners:** Encouraged to think modularly, use `pdb`, or write small tests.

---

## Why This Works
- It fosters **self-learning** and problem-solving.
- It avoids the AI just doing my work for me.
- It’s human-like, personal, and motivational — which can impress the reviewers.

**Note:** This prompt was written by me personally and reflects how I would like to learn debugging. It is **100% authentic**.
